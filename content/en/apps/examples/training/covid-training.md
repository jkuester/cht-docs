 Training for CHWs to combat COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges to providing in-person CHW training. To support CHWs, three learning modules were created to rapidly and remotely train them on COVID-19 safety protocols and patient care. Through CHT app and SMS deployments, Supervisors can now train CHWs on care workflows without being physically present. This example covers the following learning modules:

* Health safety protocols for preventing the spread of COVID-19
* Preventing the dissemination of misinformation about COVID-19
* Recognizing COVID-19 and caring for patients with suspected infection

## Problem Being Addressed

Now, more than ever, it is important for community health workers to stay safe and serve their communities by understanding effective health protocols for preventing the spread of COVID-19. This training would traditionally be done in person, however, due to public health concerns, travel and gatherings of people are limited. Health systems have been forced to quickly adapt to deliver training content in a safely distanced, timely, and effective manner.  
COVID-19's impact on the hardest-to-reach communities that often lack access to a reliable data connection, poses additional challenges to reaching the CHWs that provide care to people at the highest health risk. 

## Solution Overview

The CHT provides a flexible way to deliver timely COVID-19 remote training and education to CHWs. In collaboration with [Stanford's Digital Medic Team](https://digitalmedic.stanford.edu/), and vetted by a team of health experts at Stanford, a form-based application was designed to deliver three remote learning modules. Utilizing tasks to order the modules, CHWs can progress through training at their own pace. The training modules:

* Build on verifiable health safety guidance from the CDC and WHO
* Were carefully crafted by [Stanford's Digital Medic Team](https://digitalmedic.stanford.edu/) team and vetted by a team of health experts at Stanford
* Can be deployed using the CHT app or SMS workflows 
* Capture assessment and understanding of CHW knowledge through quizzes, which can be tracked by Supervisors

## Workflow Examples

### Remote Training by App

This demo illustrates how a CHT workflow can be easily adapted to integrate a sequence of learning modules through the usage of tasks. These modules can be delivered sequentially and learning can be tracked across CHWs.

### Remote Training by SMS

The workflow involves interacting with the CHW through SMS and utilizing text-based feedback from the CHW, along with branching logic, to promote engagement and absorption of content. CHWs can be prompted with a question and reply via a message to assess understanding of content.
